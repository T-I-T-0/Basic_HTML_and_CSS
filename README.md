HTML and CSS Project
This is a display sample website that I made using HTML and CSS

•	Space Station Site
•	Movie Theatre Site

Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It’s styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, from cards, and dropdowns.
